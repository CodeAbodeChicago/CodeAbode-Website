  <h1 class="section-title">Our Teaching Philosophy</h1>
  <p>Our curriculum at CodeAbode is built around teaching you how to learn. Programming isn’t about a specific syntax. It’s about a way of thinking and problem solving. All our classes are hands on and designed to guide you to the answering problems yourself.</p>

    <h1 class="section-title">The Full Stack Curriculum</h1>
    <p>At CodeAbode, we teach &ldquo;full stack&rdquo; web development. We start with the essential ingredients of client-side web development &ndash; HTML, CSS &amp; JS. You&rsquo;ll learn how to plan, design &amp; code an interactive website. From there, we teach server-side programming with Node.js. You&rsquo;ll learn how to make web apps and come away with a deeper understanding of how the web works. The final course &ndash; capstone projects &ndash; is about synthesis. You&rsquo;ll be given the space to design &amp; implement your own web project, with mentorship from CodeAbode instructors.</p>

  <h1 class="section-title">Full Time Vs Part Time</h1>
  <p>Our full stack curriculum can be taken as an intensive, full-time bootcamp or as part-time night classes. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you take the full curriculum in full-time or part-time form &ndash; you&rsquo;ll still be getting the same hands on instruction for the same cost.</p>
